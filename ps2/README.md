The challenges done in Level 3 Web Development in the year 2024 during the second physical session

Each `s#` corresponds to a station number, I.E. `s1` is Station 1, `s2` is Station 2

Each Station is composed up of 4 challenges that have some sort of common theme

### Station 1
- Create variables of different types (string, number, boolean, array) and perform operations that showcase their respective behaviors.
- Convert a number to a string and vice versa. Explore different methods for type
conversion in JavaScript.
- Perform boolean operations with logical operators (&&, ||, !).
- Manipulate an array by adding, removing, and updating elements

### Station 2: Variables
- Create variables inside and outside of blocks, observing how scope affects their accessibility.
- Create a set of variables with meaningful names, following best practices for variable naming in JavaScript.
- Explore different ways of declaring variables (var, let, const).
- Dynamically create variables based on user input or conditions.

### Station 3: Conditionals
- Write a program that uses if-else statements to determine whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
- Write a program that determines the day of the week based on a numeric input (1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, etc.) using if-else statements.
- Write a program that determines the grade based on a numeric score using if-else statements.
- Write a program that determines whether a given number is even or odd using if-else statements.

### Station 4: Loops
Challenges:
- Use a for loop to iterate through an array and perform a specific action for each element.
- Create a while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10. Explore different conditions to
control the loop.
- Use a for loop to iterate through a string and perform a specific action for each character.
- Create a do-while loop that counts down from 5 to 1.
